New types of travel

1. Different sites when all the other sights are exhausted ...

- man-made hills in Holland
- Skiing in UAE

2. see at a distance with an emotional feeling attached to it. Streetview wanderlust

what does it make you feel? Streetview - deep sense of longing for the place

Grey areas - restaurants in famine areas / night clubs in war zones ..

Another thing to think about - Commodification and travel

-------

By observing something, we change it.

How the travel industry might benefit from approaching the business of travel from a more philosophical and psychological angle reaping extra income and delivering pleasure along the way.

- Travel to see people
- Never imagine you are going to become a local
- Go with as few preconceptions as possible
- Never underestimate the power of simply sitting and watching
- Two weeks is enough to form impression, e.g. DH Lawrence. Any more depth requires living there for years.

What do people want?

http://www.travelblather.com/2012/07/what-is-quality-travel-content.html

In the meantime, I believe there certainly is a market for quality travel writing - but we need to adjust what we mean by “quality”. We should stop thinking about school literature prizes and ask the question that Google keeps asking itself: what do people want?

I think the answer is content that is authoritative, reliable, informative and up-to-date. People want information they can trust. Yes, they want to be inspired. But mostly they want to be guided and helped to make the right decisions. They want to know that if they are going to spend hundreds or thousands of pounds on a holiday, it is going to meet their needs and expectations.

I’ve always said that if I was going to start a travel blog I would pick a lucrative but unpopular niche. Right now I would write about all inclusive family resorts. Or cruise holidays for retired people.

Tuscany is a zombie destination: it's been done to death many times over, yet it always rises from the grave to fill more travel pages.

@evanrail Most destinations are zombies lately; I have more or less given up travel writing. Am awed that you are doing so well at it.

The homogenising impact of the global travel industry - see Small World - Martin Parr

- so much travel is lies, propaganda, "publicity" [see Berger in ways of seeing], commodification, or travel porn - created to sell something - not the truth

Laylines

Mystic thoroughfares

Psychic songlines - the city has a psychy - an organism, a mind in its own right - what is the character of this place

Cast off Work - Consume - Die

Orientating and disorientating

Cab drivers don't know where they are - come from Lagos - drive on Satnav

An experience of sublime to be had in modern air travel - but all of it is geared to make it as dull as possible. A magical experience

Micro environments joined up by air travel - know nothing in between - a grid - disorientation

Travel - defined by muscles - trains, planes, cars - 160 years ago - stopped having a physical apprehension of space when we travel.
